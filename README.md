# theBookTown

•	Create a new web application
•	Implement the ExpressJS web framework
•	Use MongoDB and Mongoose to store and connect to your data
•	Use HBS templating for your UI 
•	Add route / controller files to handle application logic
•	Customize the look and feel of your application with CSS (Bootstrap is fine but the application must look different than our in-class application example).  If you use a 3rd party stylesheet, reference the source in both your header and your README.md file.  If you do your own css, note this in the README.md file.
•	Implement Authentication so only your Home page, Register page, Login page, and Read-Only page that displays your data are public.  All other pages that perform Create-Update-Delete operations must be Private.
